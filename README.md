# Pico-Uploader
Documentation and s/w for my Pico Uploader project.
The Pico Uploaded is used to upload software to Science of Cambridge MK14 computers
and replicas.
The board simulates keyboard presses to transfer the s/w. S/W is uploaded to the 
Uploader board in Intel Hex formats, by draging and dropping the hex files to the mounted Pico CircuitPY drive.
Written instructions and a flow chart describing operaion are available here
Note the s/w is functional, it does minimal checking for errors - for instance it assumes a valid Intel Hex file format
Core elements of the s/w use original work by - SiriusHardware [https://www.vintage-radio.net/forum/member.php?u=26059]
